## Future plans to create the greatest portfolio that ever lived

* Completely redo the design to a far greater one I have in mind. More usage of fewer main colors, gradients will be a thing of the past and most importantly it will be far more personal.

* Make the site far more responsive with considerably better sass integration. There are a lot of features that I would like to implement with more time and a lot of dated code that could use different values.

* Apply JavaScript in buckets once we've learnt more of it. Keep it looking clean and simple but also sleek and elegant.
